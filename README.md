# drtools-metric visualization 

A tool that graphs data generated by drtools-metric.
The drtools-metric generates data in open standards (CSV and JSON).
This gives the developer great freedom to use and integrate with other tools of interest, from spreadsheets to machine learning tools.

Even so, we developed a tool that lets you read the data generated directly from the source code. Thus, developers view the data generated by drtools-metric simply and objectively.
